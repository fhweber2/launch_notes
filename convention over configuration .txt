In Rails, the concept of "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) is closely related to "Convention over Configuration." 

##Naming Conventions
Classes/Modules
class and module names should be nouns; in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.

    ex:
        class Raster,  class Raster::ImageSprite

##Methods

Methods should be verbs. All lower case ASCII letters with words separated by underscores ('_')
    
    example:        run(), run_fast(), obj.background_color()
##Variables

variable names should be all lower case ASCII letters with words separated by underscore ('_')
ex: 
    
    i = 1 some_char = SomeChar.new() table_width = 0.0

##Constants
constants should be all upper case with words separated by underscores ('_'). 

    ex:
        MIN_LENGTH = 1
        DEFAULT_HOST = "foo.example.com"

#Omission
Speaking of 'Connection Pool' as a variable, you should decide to prefer name by scope such as the followingâ€¦
	
    'conpool' for local scope (such as local variable)
    @connection_pool for class scope (such as instance variable)
