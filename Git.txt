Intro to GIt 

SCM - source control manager (SVN was a precursor)

Atomic Operations (research this out)

	Make any changes throughout the entire source ecosystem?
	
	File Locking (change parameters - locks files down when a user is editing - not very collaborative)
	
	Checkouts 
	
	Merge (merging two repos together) \
	
	Clone (grab a link) in GitHub
		launch terminal 
		
	ls -a flag to find hidden files
	
.gitignore tells what files not to commit

Git where does it live? FInd out more. 

git add . -- or the Directory that is being committed.

git init (watch these files)
