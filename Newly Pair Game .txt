edge cases.... 

input, output, storage, application

1. Print Instructions

2. Asks Questions

	If answer is incorrect repeat the question, again, again (research this)

		if correct a point is given (or tallied) 
		
		else incorrect then user is informed of an incorrect answer

3. The Q&A Repeats 

4. Last answer is given the points are tallied and printed or "You did not earn any points" is given

	Questions, point tally, and final statement t should read "You did not earn any points" are all outputs

-Intputs are answers

-Evaluation (point tally)

-Storage:  Questions, Answers, Tallies are stored -where and how?

-Primary loop of the questions

-'You want to store the questions and answers in an appropriate data structure so that it is easy to correlate questions and answers, and to ask them consecutively without repeating a lot of code.'

Random question generator for the 9 questions - repeats 3 times, 3 blocks, etc (try to find an method for this generation)

# Ask these questions, store answers.  No WHILE LOOPS! 
while true
  puts "Question1"
  answer = gets.chomp.downcase
  if (answer is correct - tally a point || answer =no')
    break
  else
    puts 'Please answer "yes" or "no".'
  end
end

while true
  puts ''Question2'
  answer = gets.chomp.
  if (answer == 'yes' || answer == 'no')
    break
  else
    puts 'Please answer "yes" or "no".'
  end
end

#  We pay attention to *this* answer, though.
while true
  puts 'Q3'
  answer = gets.chomp
  if (answer == 'yes' || answer == 'no')
    if answer == ''correct'
      correct = true
    else
     incorrect = false
    end
    break
  else
    puts 'Please answer "yes" or "no".'
  end
end
