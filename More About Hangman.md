Due Wednesday Morning....

MVC

Think what your models are 

Separate your business work out

    #  A 'Runner' class
    
    # creates a player
    # creates a game
    # creates  a word
    
    # A firewall between Input/Output
    
    # An MVC paradigm
    
    Player Loader 
    
    Game Launcher
    
    Draw Parallels between the Rails & Command Line 
    
    # the idea is all towards Rails (Hangman = a Rails app)
