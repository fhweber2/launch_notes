Controller is like a Manager

Views job is to present to the user

The Model does the Business

Controller sits in the middle and delegates to the Model & Views - the Bridge!

The controller (Office Space - Speaks to the Engineers so that the customers don't have to clip)

This is a great metaphor Controller as a Manager

Rails

    app/models
        presenters
        cat_graphs ("a cat domain")
    
    config/application.rb
    
        config.load_paths < [foo.bar.baz]
        
        rails a short path (make your models short)
            presenters
            buckets
        all of this is in your LOAD Path


Tests

    takes practice to write good tests
    
    the tests are the actual description of your application 
    
    or what you are trying to do
    
    describe the flow from the users perspective
    
    CGI
    
    CGI.escape
