Blocks & Iterators

  Convention: 
  
    {  } for one line blocks 
    
    and the 
    
    do 
    
      end 
      
      -for multiple lines of code to evaluate 
      
    In CLI programs

    **gets is an infinite loop
        
            while 1 do
                
                puts 5 
                
            end  #badness here
            
        try to use the "break" loop sparingly 
        
       NewlyPair conditional logic, variables, loops, iterators
        
    
        [1,2,3,].each { |num| puts "hello number #{num}" }
            
   Hash: or an associated array
   
        2 ways to 
   
    associated array == hash 
    
    arrays as keys
    
    use the underscore _  (hash =_ ) to 
    
    new syntax  the symbol for hashes e.g. { : }
    
Trace

    Have a notebook to walk through this when tracing
    
    You must think like the prgm
    
                        hash
                        
                        {
                        
                        }
    
                        name
        
        
                        xxxx (this will change)
