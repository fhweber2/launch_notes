Create a public pivotal tracker for breakable toy

Use "Icebox" to "Create an Issue"

Description (create - user stories):
    
####"As a,  blankety-blank

#### I want to blank"

The ability to rank user stories using the Fibonacci Series (to effectively score/weight each user story)

	  Ranking user stories using the Fibonacci Series in Pivotal Tracker...to find & rank the complexity score of a user stories (relative complexity)

***Holy Shit, this is similar to Course of Action (COA) development in the Military Decision Making  Process(MDMP)!


###Epics, for the big picture: 

Epics allow your team to plan, discuss, and keep track of progress of coarse-grained features or themes, at a level higher than individual stories.

####Workflow in Pivotal

Start a feature (git pull origin master)

    git pull origin master 
                        |
             #a git fetch origin
                        |
            #git merge origin/master

Review Branching from Pre-Work

    git add remote origin
    
    git push origin # for the create_issue
