GitHub recently added the capability for users to view their .geojson files in a viewer that is supported by Mapbox, Leaflet, and OSM.  

The docs have some good instructions on what file formats are acceptable for direct viewing in a Repo on GitHub:

https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github

Although, there are several things that the 'docs' don't really get into, such as understanding projections, filetypes, and other GIS-centric topics that you need to have a grasp of. 

The GeoJSON spec can be found here to dive deeper:
