 Notes (Highlights):

1. Convention over Configuration Exercise  - our example was how an automobile is similar in design of the driver's control / plus the military uniform analogy that I didn't come up with until the actual briefing...total R mode there.  

	Uniformity example - BDUs Badges Patches etc.

2. Pair Programming - sniper observer example

3. TDD Red Green Refactor Drives Design

	Write tests to fail before writing production code 
	test than refactor the code 
	Use Ruby Libraries (specific) for testing purposes - deep dive this 
	
4. MVC: 

	Model 				View
		    \			  /
		    	Controller		    
		    	
5. Outside-In Development 
	User stories & Acceptance Criteria makes it testable

6.  Problem solving:  Spike -> Integration -> TDD
