As a programmer you want to verbally say what your program is doing - be expressive

    1.9.3p392 :030 > 3 == 2
    => false
    1.9.3p392 :031 > 3 == 3
    => true
    1.9.3p392 :032 > 3 != 3
     => false

Class =
    Factory
    
Instance 
    Version 

true and false (they're singletons and instances of themselves!?!)

####-When you pass logic there is a chance of a bug if you do not conduct test (must evaluate all conditionals) e.g., else statements...an opportunity for a unlikely use case or error to occur (must anticipate the other branch of this)
