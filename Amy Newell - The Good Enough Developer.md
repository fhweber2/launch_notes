###"The Good Enough Developer"

software product "POGO" 

Software doesn't have to be perfect - just get it done

Life may make choices for you...being a top developer isn't about what you do at work, it's what you do outside of work.

The job cycle is to change roles every 2 to 3 years.  Have some loyalty to your employer (use your past service as evidence)

Ask for help.  Play to your strengths.
