Ruby foundations exercise (optional): Take a phone number as input. 

Then give back the letters associated with each number in the input phone number. 

Try to write it in an object oriented way. 

Then, remove the code and try to write it in a test driven way  
Use the first letter on the keypad 
		  If you complete that and want to do more, validate the length and format of the phone number to ensure you can tabulate the string
